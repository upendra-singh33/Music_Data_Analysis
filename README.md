Music Store Data Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of music store data using SQL. The goal of this project is to extract valuable insights from the data to help improve business decisions related to sales, inventory, and customer behavior.

Project Overview
In this project, I performed SQL queries on a music store dataset to analyze various aspects of the business, including sales performance, customer demographics, and popular products. The analysis focuses on answering key business questions such as:

Sales Analysis: Identifying top-selling genres, products, and trends over time.
Customer Behavior: Analyzing purchasing patterns based on customer demographics.
Product Trends: Finding patterns in the sales of different products across different periods.
Getting Started


To explore the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Open the SQL files(music_store_analysis) to view and run the queries. The queries can be executed in your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with access to the dataset.

Review the results of the queries to gain insights into the data.

Key Insights
Top-selling genres: Identified the most popular music genres in the store.
